# Playing with FI/RE: Optimizing Your Own Financial Journey

## Abstract

The FI/RE (financial independence/ retire early) movement has been going on for many years and seems to connect with many people in software engineering.  However, I have only known of it for less than a year.  This talk is what I wish I would have heard many years ago.  First I will explain what is financial independence as well as the primitives involved. (active income vs passive income; long term stock market growth rate and index funds) Second, we explore various paths of obtaining financial independence.  (Savings rate trade-offs, reduced hours; working only part of the year)  Lastly, we swing back to question if financial independence is the correct goal.  (having all basic needs met indefinitely is more than necessary because we don't live forever)
